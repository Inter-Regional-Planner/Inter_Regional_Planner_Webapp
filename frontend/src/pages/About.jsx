            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that Caribbean talent should be able to move freely
              across the region with clarity and confidence. The Inter Regional
              Movement Planner was created to bridge the gap between CARICOM
              policies and real-world user experience.
            </p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clear, personalized guidance on how to work across CSME Member
                States
              </li>
              <li>
                Transparent requirements for each category and country
              </li>
              <li>
                Practical tools like checklists, timelines, and official links
              </li>
              <li>
                A simple digital space where anyone—student, professional, or
                employer—can understand and navigate regional mobility
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By translating policy into an intuitive digital planner, we aim to
              support economic opportunity, strengthen regional integration, and
              help build a more connected Caribbean workforce.
