      <h2>What is the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)?</h2>
      <p>
        The CSME is an arrangement among CARICOM Member States to create a single
        enlarged economic space by removing restrictions on the movement of
        goods, services, persons, capital and the right of establishment.
      </p>

      <h2>Free Movement of Skills / Labour</h2>
      <p>
        Under Article 46 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, eligible CARICOM
        nationals can move to another participating Member State to seek work and
        engage in gainful employment without needing a separate work permit,
        once they have a valid CARICOM Skills Certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free movement of skills does <strong>not</strong> automatically grant
        permanent residency or citizenship. You must still follow the immigration
        and residency laws of the host country.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Can Move?</h2>
      <p>Approved categories generally include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>University graduates</li>
        <li>Artistes and musicians</li>
        <li>Media workers and sportspersons</li>
        <li>Nurses and teachers</li>
        <li>Artisans and holders of associate degrees</li>
        <li>Domestic, agricultural and private security workers</li>
      </ul>

        Always confirm the latest list of categories and requirements from
        official government or CARICOM sources.
