            <h2>What is the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)?</h2>
            <p>
              The CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) is an arrangement
              among Member States to create a single economic space. It allows
              for the free movement of goods, services, people, capital, and the
              right of establishment across participating Caribbean countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              For individuals, the most important part is{" "}
              <strong>Free Movement of Skills</strong>, which gives eligible
              CARICOM nationals the right to work in another participating
              Member State without a traditional work permit.
            </p>

            <h3>Free Movement of Skills</h3>
            <p>
              Eligible CARICOM nationals can live and work in another
              participating country once they hold a valid{" "}
              <strong>Skills Certificate</strong> and meet immigration
              requirements.

          <div className="feature-card">
            <h3>Skills Certificate</h3>
            <p>
              A document issued by a Competent Authority which confirms that you
              belong to an approved category (e.g. university graduate, nurse,
              teacher, artisan). It is usually required before you can work in a
              host country.
            </p>

          <div className="feature-card">
            <h3>Not Citizenship or Residency</h3>
            <p>
              Free movement under CSME does <strong>not</strong> automatically
              grant permanent residency or citizenship. It gives you the right
              to seek and take up employment, subject to each country&apos;s
              laws.
