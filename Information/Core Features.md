1. Recommended Tech Stack

To keep it “software-dominant” but manageable:

Frontend

React (Vite or Create React App)

React Router (for pages)

State: React Context or simple props/state

Backend (optional but nice)

Node.js + Express serving:

Static JSON data (countries, categories, checklists)

Optional: saving user plans (if you want accounts)

For an Olympiad, you could even:

Start as frontend-only with JSON config files.

Add Express later if you want bonus points.
